# DotGeometry

DotGeometry is a 2D geometry library designed to construct and discretize 2D domains using simple geometries.

## Features
- Creation of exact geometric objects:
  - Points
  - Circles
  - Line segments
  - BÃ©zier curves
  - Polygonal chains
  - Circles/Circular arcs
- Discretization of geometries
- Visualization of geometries

## Installation

To install DotGeometry, add it directly from the source using Julia's package manager:

```bash
] add https://github.com/renatospacek/DotGeometry.jl
```

## Examples

You can find examples of how to use DotGeometry in this [examples](examples/examples.ipynb) file.
